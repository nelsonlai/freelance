- Implement continuous deployment

## 📚 CI/CD Concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
```

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Deploy to Vercel
      uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
      with:
        vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
        vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Complete CI/CD Pipeline
Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:

**Solution:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/full-pipeline.yml
name: Full CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'

jobs:
  # Test job
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --coverage
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Run type checking
      run: npm run type-check
    
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage/lcov.info
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist/
  
  # Deploy job (only on main branch)
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Download build artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist/
    
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        # Add deployment commands here
    
    - name: Notify deployment
      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        channel: '#deployments'
        webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```
