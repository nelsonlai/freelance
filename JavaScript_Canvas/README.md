## 💡 Tips for Learning

- Don't just read the code - modify it and see what happens!
- Try to recreate examples from memory after studying them
- Combine concepts from different examples
- Build your own projects using the techniques you learn

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## 📝 Notes

Each example is self-contained and can be opened directly in a browser. All code is heavily commented to aid learning.
