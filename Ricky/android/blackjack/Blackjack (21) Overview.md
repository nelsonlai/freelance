Blackjack (21) Overview
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game often played in casinos. The goal is to have a hand value close to 21 without going over.

Game Rules
Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what helps the hand.
Game Play:

Each player and the dealer get two cards.
Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
If a player's total goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the round.
The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.
Winning the Game:

If a player's total is closer to 21 than the dealer's, the player wins.
If the dealer's total is closer, the dealer wins.
If both have the same total, it's a tie (called a "push").
Special Cases:

If a player gets an Ace and a 10-point card as their first two cards, it's called "Blackjack." This usually pays 1.5 times the bet.
Strategy Tips
Basic Strategy: Know when to hit or stand based on the dealer's card.
Splitting: If you have two cards of the same value, you can split them into two hands.
Doubling Down: After the first two cards only, you can double your bet and take only one more card.
