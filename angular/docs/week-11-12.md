# Weeks 11-12: Capstone Delivery & Production Polish

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate previous weeks’ work into a cohesive SaaS admin portal capstone.
- Implement production-level concerns: documentation, analytics, logging, accessibility, and deployment automation.
- Harden performance with SSR/hydration checks, PWA support, and bundle budgets.
- Prepare demo artifacts (README, architecture diagrams, walkthrough video).

## Core Concepts & References
- Angular Docs: [PWA Guide](https://angular.dev/guide/pwa), [Deployment](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/deployment)
- Lighthouse: [Scoring and Audits](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
- Accessibility: [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/)
- Documentation: [Arc42 Template](https://arc42.org/) for architecture notes

## Hands-On Checklist
1. Assemble feature modules/routes (dashboard, customers, admin) under shared design system.
2. Enable SSR + hydration for marketing/dashboard routes; verify with Angular Universal.
3. Add PWA support (service worker, offline caching, manifest) via `ng add @angular/pwa`.
4. Configure logging/monitoring (e.g., Sentry, OpenTelemetry) and environment-specific configs.
5. Finalize CI/CD pipeline to run lint/tests/build/deploy (GitHub Actions sample provided below).
6. Prepare documentation: README, ADRs, architecture diagrams, deployment instructions.
7. Record demo video or storyboard showing user journeys and technical highlights.

## Deliverable: SaaS Admin Portal Demo & Documentation
- Deployed demo or local instructions with seeded data.
- Documentation bundle with architecture overview, setup steps, testing strategy, and performance report.
- Lighthouse scores: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, Best Practices ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 90.
- Testing pipeline results attached/summarized.

## Suggested Daily Breakdown
- **Day 1**: Integrate modules, verify navigation, tighten design system usage.
- **Day 2**: SSR + hydration checks, adjust API calls for server runtime.
- **Day 3**: PWA/service worker setup, offline smoke tests.
- **Day 4**: Add monitoring/logging + environment configs; run performance audits.
- **Day 5**: Polish docs (README, ADR), capture architecture diagram (PlantUML/Mermaid).
- **Day 6**: Script and record demo video; gather screenshots.
- **Day 7**: Final QA pass, update backlog for future improvements.

## Supporting Assets
- **CI Workflow Template** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint → test → build → e2e.
- **Performance Audit Template** (`docs/performance-audit-template.md`): capture metrics pre/post optimization.
- **Release Checklist**:
  - ✅ Increment version + changelog
  - ✅ Run `ng test`, `ng e2e`, `ng build --configuration production`
  - ✅ Verify Lighthouse PWA/SSR scores on staging URL
  - ✅ Confirm error monitoring dashboards receiving events
  - ✅ Update README with latest deployment instructions

## Reflection & Extension
- Identify automation gaps (data seeding, migrations) and plan future sprints.
- Explore multi-tenant features (per-tenant theming, RBAC) as next steps.
- Stretch goal: implement infrastructure as code (Pulumi/Terraform) for hosting environment.
