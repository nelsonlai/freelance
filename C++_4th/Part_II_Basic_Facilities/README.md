- Dynamic memory allocation (new/delete)
- Smart pointers introduction

### Chapters 8-12: Structures, Control Flow, and Functions
**Learning Outcomes:**
- Master user-defined types (struct, enum, union)
- Understand control flow statements
- Learn function design and overloading
- Master lambda functions and expressions

**Key Topics:**
- Structures, unions, and enumerations
- Control flow (if, switch, loops)
- Function declarations and definitions
- Parameter passing mechanisms
- Function overloading and templates
- Lambda functions and closures
- Type conversions and casts

### Chapters 13-15: Exception Handling and Program Organization
**Learning Outcomes:**

- Exception safety guarantees
- RAII pattern implementation
- Namespace declarations and using
- Header guards and includes
- Linkage and compilation units

## 🧩 Practice Areas

1. **Type System**: Understanding C++ types and conversions
2. **Memory Management**: Pointers, references, and RAII
3. **Control Flow**: Complex program logic and flow control
4. **Function Design**: Parameter passing, overloading, and templates
5. **Exception Safety**: Robust error handling and resource management
6. **Code Organization**: Namespaces, headers, and modular design

## 🏆 Capstone Project: Modular Text Parser

Build a comprehensive text parser that demonstrates all concepts from Part II.

### Project Requirements:
- Modular design with separate header/source files
- Exception-safe resource management
- Multiple parsing strategies (function overloading)
- Error recovery and reporting
- Namespace organization
- Memory-efficient string handling

### Learning Outcomes:
- Apply advanced C++ language features
- Master exception safety patterns
- Implement robust error handling
- Design modular, maintainable code
- Use modern C++ memory management
