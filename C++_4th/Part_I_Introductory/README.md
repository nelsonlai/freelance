# 🩵 Part I – Introductory Material (Chapters 1-5)

## 📘 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand C++ design philosophy and compilation model
- Master basic C++ syntax, types, and memory model
- Learn fundamental abstraction mechanisms
- Use STL containers and algorithms effectively
- Handle errors with exceptions
- Implement basic concurrency concepts

## 📚 Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Notes to the Reader
**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand C++ design philosophy
- Learn about type safety and compilation model
- Grasp programming paradigms supported by C++

**Key Concepts:**
- Static typing and type safety
- Compilation process
- Programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, generic, functional)

### Chapters 2-5: A Tour of C++
**Learning Outcomes:**
- Master C++ syntax fundamentals
- Understand variables, loops, functions, and error handling
- Learn classes, constructors, and destructors
- Use STL containers and algorithms
- Implement basic threading concepts

**Key Topics:**
- Variables, loops, functions
- Error handling with exceptions
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- STL containers (vector, map)
- STL algorithms (sort, find)
- Threading basics (std::thread, std::async)

## 🧩 Practice Areas

1. **Basic Syntax**: Variables, loops, functions
2. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, constructors, destructors
3. **STL Usage**: Containers and algorithms
4. **Error Handling**: Exception safety
5. **Concurrency**: Basic threading concepts

## 🏆 Capstone Project: Command-Line Calculator

Build a comprehensive calculator that demonstrates all concepts from Part I.

### Project Requirements:
- User-defined classes for different operations
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
- STL containers for operation history
- Basic threading for complex calculations
- Clean, modular code structure

### Learning Outcomes:
- Apply all Part I concepts in a real project
- Practice class design and implementation
- Master exception handling patterns
- Use STL effectively
- Implement basic concurrency
