### 🎯 Overview

This comprehensive curriculum is designed to take students from complete beginners to advanced C programmers over a 16-week period. The curriculum is structured around the classic "The C Programming Language" book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, enhanced with modern teaching practices, extensive code examples, practical exercises, and real-world projects.

### 📚 Curriculum Structure

The course is divided into four progressive levels:

- **🟢 Beginner (Weeks 1-4)**: Basic syntax, data types, control flow
- **🟡 Intermediate (Weeks 5-8)**: Functions, arrays, pointers
- **🟠 Advanced (Weeks 9-12)**: Structures, file I/O, memory management
