1. Czochralski (CZ) Method

Most widely used for producing single-crystal silicon ingots (especially for integrated circuits).

Process:

Start with high-purity polycrystalline silicon melted in a quartz crucible.

A seed crystal of known orientation is dipped into the melt.

The seed is slowly pulled upward while rotating in opposite direction from the crucible.

A large, cylindrical single crystal (ingot) grows as the melt solidifies onto the seed.

Features:

Diameter: up to 300 mm (12 inches) or more.

Doping (e.g., with boron or phosphorus) can be controlled precisely.

May contain oxygen impurities from the quartz crucible.
