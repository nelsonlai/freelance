# Blockchain Implementation Requirements
# 
# This implementation uses only Python standard library modules:
# - hashlib (for SHA-256 hashing)
# - json (for data serialization)
# - time (for timestamps)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - datetime (for date formatting)
# - collections (for defaultdict)
#
# No external dependencies required!
#
# Python 3.7+ is recommended for full type hint support.
