## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice

### Complete Working Example

The `examples/` directory contains a fully functional application demonstrating:

1. **Backend** (`examples/backend/`)
   - Complete NestJS application
   - Tasks and Users modules
   - All RESTful endpoints
   - Validation and error handling

2. **Frontend** (`examples/frontend/`)
   - Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
   - Interactive API testing
   - Real-time updates
   - All HTTP methods demonstrated

### How to Use the Examples

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Open the frontend**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/public/index.html
   ```

3. **Try all operations**:
   - Create, read, update, delete resources
   - See API responses in real-time
   - Test all HTTP methods
