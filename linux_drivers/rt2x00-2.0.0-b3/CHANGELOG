 - Version: rt2x00 beta 3
	# Increase all offsets of USB registers with 0x0400. (27 October 2005)
	# Change build process, ieee80211 are build at same time as rt2x00. (03 November 2005)
	# rt2500usb EEPROM access should not be byteordered. (10 November 2005)
	# The MAC address should be printed from core module. (10 November 2005)
	# Wait with PCI interrupt line registration untill device is initialized. (10 November 2005)
	# Perform optimizations to reduce stack size of several functions. (11 November 2005)
	# Periodically update statistics from device (i.e. noise). (11 November 2005)
	# When authentication has timed out, check what step needs to be retried. (11 November 2005)
	# Implement signal level measurement and periodically update this. (12 November 2005)
	# rt2500usb EEPROM is little endian. (15 November 2005)
	# Correctly handle little endian to big endian conversions. (17 November 2005)
	# Don't report BSSID with iwconfig when not associated. (19 November 2005)
	# Don't attempt to connect to encrypted networks when encryption is disabled. (19 November 2005)
	# Allow scanning while interface is down by temporarily enabling radio. (21 November 2005)
	# Remove overhead in get_scan ioctl by using semaphores instead of msleep(). (22 November 2005)
	# By default and invalid geography setting should allow channels 1 to 11 and no 5GHz. (23 November 2005)
	# Add wireless event handling for association/disassociation and scan completion. (25 November 2005)
	# Base set_security() on the same implementation as the ipw2200 driver. (27 November 2005)
	# Add private ioctl calls {set,get}_adhoc_ofdm for 54Mbit support in ad-hoc mode. (01 December 2005)
	# USB requires its DMA buffers to be 2400 bytes for RX and 2342 bytes for TX. (03 December 2005)
	# Write size of rx data bufer to the device register, preventing overlapping data. (04 December 2005)
	# USB device should not use its own sequence number inside TX frames. (04 December 2005)
	# ACK timeout and consume time should be calculated with 1Mb/s instead of active speed. (04 December 2005)
	# Only read EEPROM at probe time, store BBP init information in private structure. (08 December 2005)
