# Our playground
# Iput and Output: Input age and output your age after 10 years

# Sample Expected Output:
# Enter first number: 5
# Enter second number: 3
# Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
# Result: 15

# Example: (with/without) a third variable
# Before: a = 3, b = 5
# After: a = 5, b = 3

# Area = length * width
# Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Sample Output:
# Enter a number: 7
# Output: Odd

# Formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32

#Fibonacci Sequence
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
* Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
* Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
* Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Hint: Floyd's cycle detection algorithm

Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Explanation:
The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation:
All elements are distinct.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
