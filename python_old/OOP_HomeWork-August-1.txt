Homework 1: In python class, how many double underscore methods are available? What their purpose on each?

Homework 2: Library Book Tracker (Class & Instance Methods)
📌 Objective:
Create a Book class that represents a book in a library system.

✏️ Requirements:
Attributes: title, author, year, is_checked_out (boolean)

Method check_out() that marks the book as checked out

Method check_in() that marks the book as available

@classmethod to count how many books have been created

🧪 Example:
book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949)
book1.check_out()
book1.check_in()
Book.total_books_created()  # e.g., returns 1
🏠 Homework 2: Animal Kingdom (Inheritance + Polymorphism)
📌 Objective:
Practice inheritance and method overriding using animals.

✏️ Requirements:
Create a base class Animal with method make_sound()

Create subclasses Dog, Cat, Cow that override make_sound()

Write a function speak_all(animals) that loops through a list and calls .make_sound() on each

🧪 Example:
animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Cow()]
speak_all(animals)
Expected output:

Woof!
Meow!
Moo!
🏠 Homework 3: Banking System (Encapsulation + Static Method)
📌 Objective:
Use encapsulation and static methods in a banking context.

✏️ Requirements:
Class BankAccount with private balance attribute __balance

Methods: deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), get_balance()

Static method validate_amount(amount) that returns True if amount > 0

🧪 Example:
acc = BankAccount("Alice")
acc.deposit(500)
acc.withdraw(200)
print(acc.get_balance())  # Output: 300

## In a class,what __xxx__ do we have? and what is it for on each?
__init__
__str__
__repr__
__len__
