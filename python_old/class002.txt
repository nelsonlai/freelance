0) Warm‑Up (0–5 min)

Quick five: (students answer verbally or in REPL)

What is a variable?

What does input() return?

Convert the string '42' to a number.

What does // do?

Show $12.5 using an f‑string with 2 decimals.

Answers: named box for a value; a string; int('42'); integer division; f"${12.5:.2f}".

1) Booleans & Comparisons (5–15 min)

Concepts: True, False, comparison operators: < <= > >= == !=

Demo:

print(5 > 2)       # True
print(7 == 7)      # True
print(3 != 3)      # False
print("a" < "b")  # True (lexicographic)

If / elif / else + indentation:

age = int(input("Age: "))
if age < 13:
    print("Child")
    print("Hello")
elif age < 18:      # elif
    print("Teen")
else:
    print("Adult")

Common pitfalls

Single = is assignment; use == for comparison.

Indentation is part of Python (4 spaces recommended).

Quick practice (2 min): Write a program that asks for a test score (0–100) and prints Pass if ≥ 60 else Fail.

2) Logical Operators & Input Validation (15–25 min)

and, or, not:

age = int(input("Age: "))
if 13 <= age <= 18:
    print("Teen")

if age >=13 and age <=18:
    print("Teen")

if temp == None: # NULL
if not temp:

if not temp < 0:    ## if temp > 0:
temp = float(input("Temp (C): "))
if temp < 0 or temp > 35:   # and or not
    print("Extreme weather warning!")
    xxx
    yyy

raining = True
if not raining:
    print("No umbrella needed.")

Validation pattern:

people = int(input("How many people? "))
if people <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive number.")
else:
    print("Thanks! We'll continue…")

if age > 18:
    xxxx
    yyyy
else:
    pass

if news < 12:
    yyy
elif news !=0 :
    zzz
else:
    pass

if xxx > 0:
    xxx
elif zzz > 0:
    yyy
    if aa < 0:
        bbb
    elif ccc > 10:
        mmm
    elif kkk < mmm:
        uuu
    else:
        pass
else:
    kkk

if condition_a:
    do_something
else:
    pass
if condition_b:
    ....
else:
    pass
if condition_c:
    xxxxx
else:
    pass

another_line ...


Quick practice (3 min): Ask for a mark (0–100). If outside range, print an error; otherwise print A/B/C/D/F using simple thresholds (e.g., A≥90, B≥80…).

3) while Loops (25–38 min)

Structure: repeat while a condition is True.

count = 1
while count <= 3:
    print("Hello #", count)
    count = count + 1   # update to avoid infinite loop

break and continue:

while True:
    text = input("Type anything (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if text == 'q':
        break           # exit loop
    if text.strip() == "":
        continue        # skip blank inputs
    print("You typed:", text)

print ("End program")

Validation loop (classic):

while True:
    people = input("People (positive integer): ")
    if people.isdigit() and int(people) > 0:
        people = int(people)
        break
    print("Invalid. Try again.")

Mini drill (2 min): Print numbers 1..10 on one line separated by spaces. (Hint: counter variable and end=' ')

n = 1
while n <= 10:
    print(n, end=' ')
    n += 1
print()  # newline

4) Mini‑Project — Number Guessing Game (38–48 min)

Goal: Computer picks a number; player guesses with limited attempts; program gives hints.

Specs:

Range: 1–100

Attempts: 7

Each turn: validate input, say "Too high" / "Too low" / "Correct!"

End: show the number if not guessed

Plan:

import random   # pick secret = random.randint(1, 100)

attempts_left = 7

loop while attempts remain and not guessed

read input, validate integer in range; otherwise, warn and continue

compare; print hint; decrement attempts

after loop, report win/lose

Code (build step by step):

import random
print("Welcome to Number Guessing!")
secret = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts_left = 7

while attempts_left > 0:
    guess_text = input(f"Guess a number (1-100). Attempts left {attempts_left}: ")
    if not guess_text.isdigit():
        print("Please enter a whole number.")
        continue
    guess = int(guess_text)
    if not 1 <= guess <= 100:
        print("Number must be between 1 and 100.")
        continue

    if guess == secret:
        print("🎉 Correct! You win!")
        break
    elif guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")

    attempts_left -= 1

if attempts_left == 0:
    print(f"Out of attempts. The number was {secret}.")

Stretch (if time):

Difficulty mode: Easy (10 tries), Hard (5 tries).

Track best score (fewest attempts) across games.

Ask "Play again? (y/n)" → while loop around the whole game.

5) Exit Ticket (48–50 min)

What is the difference between = and ==?

When would you use while True with a break?

Write a condition that is true when age is a teen (13–19 inclusive).

Sample answers: assignment vs comparison; for loops with unknown length or repeated prompts; 13 <= age <= 19.

Homework (15–25 minutes)

Letter Grader: Input a score (0–100). Validate. Then print A/B/C/D/F (A≥90…).

PIN Lock: Ask for a secret PIN (hard‑code as "1234"). The user has 3 attempts. On success → "Unlocked"; else → "Locked out".

Temperature Advisor: Ask for temperature in °C and whether it’s raining (y/n). Print suggestions: coat, sunscreen, umbrella, etc., using combined conditions.

Stretch: Convert your Number Guessing Game into a loop that asks to play again until the user types n.

Instructor Notes & Troubleshooting

Infinite loops: Always ensure the loop condition changes.

Input conversion: Don’t compare numbers to strings.

Compound conditions: Use parentheses to make intent clear.

Random: random.randint(a, b) includes both endpoints.

Testing: Try edge values (1, 100) and invalid inputs (letters, empty, negatives).

Answer Key Snippets (for instructor)

Letter Grader (simple thresholds):

mark = input("Mark (0-100): ")
if not mark.isdigit():
    print("Invalid")
else:
    m = int(mark)
    if not 0 <= m <= 100:
        print("Invalid")
    elif m >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif m >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif m >= 70:
        print("C")
    elif m >= 60:
        print("D")
    else:
        print("F")

PIN Lock (3 tries):

SECRET = "1234"
tries = 3
while tries > 0:
    pin = input("PIN: ")
    if pin == SECRET:
        print("Unlocked")
        break
    tries -= 1
    print("Wrong PIN. Tries left:", tries)
if tries == 0:
    print("Locked out")
