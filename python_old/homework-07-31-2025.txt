Section 1 - Regular Expressions

1. Extract Valid Dates (dd/mm/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy)
Task:
Write a regex to extract all valid dates from a text in formats:
25/12/2025
01-01-1999
Conditions:
Day: 01-31
Month: 01-12
Year: 1900-2099
Example Input:
"Events: 25/12/2025, 31-02-2024, 01-01-1999"
Expected Output:
['25/12/2025', '01-01-1999']
(Hint: Ignore invalid dates like 31-02-2024 for now; just pattern match ranges.)

2. Find All Hashtags with Rules
Task:
Extract all hashtags that:
Start with #
Followed by letters or digits, but cannot start with a digit
Stop when encountering a space or punctuation
Example Input:
"Learning #Python3 is fun! Follow #100DaysOfCode and #AI_Projects"
Expected Output:
['#Python3', '#AI_Projects']
3. Validate Canadian Postal Codes
Task:
Write a regex to validate Canadian postal codes:
Format: A1A 1A1 or A1A1A1 (allow optional space)
First letter: [ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY] (no D, F, I, O, Q, U, W, Z)
Example Inputs:
L4J 2K4  (valid)
D1A 2B3  (invalid)
K1A0B1   (valid)
Exprcted Output:
['L4J 2K4', 'K1A0B1']

4. Extract HTML Tag Contents
Task:
Write a regex to extract the text inside <p> tags from HTML content.
Example Input:
"<p>Hello</p><div>World</div><p>Regex is fun</p>"
Expected Output:
['Hello', 'Regex is fun']
(Hint: Use a non-greedy match .*?.)

5. Match Floating Point Numbers (Including Scientific Notation)
Task:
Find all valid floating point numbers in a text:
Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 2e10, -1.23E-4
Should match both standard and scientific notation.
Example Input:
"Values: 3.14, -0.5, 2e10, +6.022E23, hello, 42"
Expected Output:
['3.14', '-0.5', '2e10', '+6.022E23']

6. Match IP Addresses
Task:
Find all valid IP addresses in a text.
Examples: 127.0.0.1, 89.0.142.86, 89.207.132.170
Example Input:
"IP addresses: 127.0.0.1, 89.0.142.86, 89.207.132.170"
Expected Output:
['127.0.0.1', '89.0.142.86', '89.207.132.170']

Section 2 - Leetcode Problems (Array)
1. Two Sum
Task:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Expected Output:
[0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

2. Maximum Subarray Sum
Task:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Example Input:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Expected Output:
6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Hint
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
