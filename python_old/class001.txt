0) Setup & What is Python? (0–5 min)

Programming: Telling a computer step‑by‑step how to do a task.
Python: A popular, beginner‑friendly language used for web apps, data, AI, games, and automation.
Two ways to run Python:
REPL (interactive shell): try one line at a time.
Script (.py file): save and run a whole program.
Open a REPL (choose one):
macOS/Linux: open Terminal, type python3 (or python) and press Enter.
Windows: open Command Prompt / PowerShell, type python.
You should see something like: >>> (the prompt).

1) First Contact (5–10 min)
Demo (you type; they copy):
print("Hello, world!")
Output: Hello, world!

Explain functions: print is a function that shows text on screen.
Explain strings: text inside quotes. Try single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

Quick practice (1 min):
Print your name.

Print 2 + 3 (without quotes). What happens?

print(2 + 3)   # 5, because these are numbers (no quotes)
print("2 + 3") # shows the text 2 + 3 (with quotes)
print('2 + 3')

2) Values, Types, Expressions, Variables (10–18 min)
Concepts:
Values: data like 42, 3.14, 'hi', "hi".
Types: int (whole numbers), float (decimals), str (text).
Expressions: combinations like 2 * 5 + 1.
Variables: named boxes that store values.
Demo:
# numbers
3 + 4            # 7
10 / 3           # 3.3333333333 (float division)
10 // 3          # 3 (integer division)
10 % 3           # 1 (remainder)
2 ** 5           # 32 (power)

# strings
"Py" + "thon"    # 'Python' (concatenate)
"ha" * 3         # 'hahaha' (repeat)

# variables
age = 15
pi = 3.14159
first_name = "Lydia"

print(age)
print(pi)
print(first_name)

Notes on names:

Use snake_case: my_score, not myScore (both work; this is style).

Names can have letters, digits, underscores; cannot start with a digit.

Quick practice (2 min):
Make variables: name, height_cm, favourite_food.
Print a sentence with them using f‑strings:

name = "Evan"
height_cm = 165
favourite_food = "sushi"
print(f"Hi, I'm {name}. I'm {height_cm} cm tall and I like {favourite_food}.")

3) Input & Type Conversion (18–25 min)
Problem: input() returns text (str). Convert to number if needed.

Demo:
user = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {user}")
# Add two numbers from input
a = input("First number: ")
b = input("Second number: ")
# Convert strings to numbers
a = int(a)
a = float(a)
b = float(b)
print("Sum:", a + b)

Common mistake: forgetting to convert, e.g. "2" + "3" → '23' (string join), not 5.
Try it now (2 min):
Ask for a person’s birth year, compute approximate age: current_year - birth_year.
current_year = 2025
birth_year = int(input("Birth year: "))
age = current_year - birth_year
print(f"You are about {age} years old.")

4) Mini‑Project — Tip Splitter (25–38 min)
Goal: Write a program that helps friends split a restaurant bill with a tip.

Spec:
Ask: bill total, tip percent, number of people.
Compute: total with tip; per person amount (rounded to 2 decimals).
Plan (whiteboard):
Read inputs (float, int).
Compute tip amount → bill * tip_percent / 100.
Compute total → bill + tip_amount.
Compute per_person → total / people.
Print a friendly message.

Code (build it step‑by‑step):

print("Welcome to Tip Splitter!")

bill = float(input("Bill total ($): "))
tip_percent = float(input("Tip percent (%): "))
people = int(input("How many people? "))

# calculations
tip_amount = bill * tip_percent / 100
total = bill + tip_amount
per_person = total / people

# round to 2 decimals for money display
print("\n--- Receipt ---")
print(f"Bill: ${bill}")
print(f"Tip ({tip_percent}%): ${round(tip_amount, 2)}")
print(f"Total: ${round(total, 2)}")
print(f"Each person pays: ${round(per_person, 2)}")

Stretch ideas (if time):

Validate people > 0 (guard against divide‑by‑zero).

Format with :.2f in f‑strings: f"${per_person:.2f}".

5) Quick Checks & Bug‑Fixing (38–45 min)

Predict the output:

x = 2
x = x + 3
print(x)

name = "Ada"
print("Hello, " + name)
print(f"Hello, {name}")

Find and fix the bug:

age = input("Age: ")
print(age + 1)   # Why is this wrong? Fix it.

Answer: Convert to int: age = int(input("Age: ")).

bill = float(input("Bill: "))
people = int(input("People: "))
print("Per person:", bill / people) # What happens if people == 0?

Answer: Add a check before dividing.

6) Wrap‑Up (45–50 min)

Exit Ticket (collect answers or discuss):

What’s the difference between "5" and 5 in Python?

What does input() return and why do we sometimes use int() or float() with it?

In your own words, what is a variable?

Key takeaways:

Python programs are built from values, types, variables, and functions.

print() shows output; input() reads text.

Convert types for math (int, float).

Homework (10–20 minutes total)

Greeter+1: Ask for a name and age. Print: Hello <name>! Next year you will be <age+1>.  (Remember to convert.)

Celsius↔Fahrenheit:

Ask for Celsius, print Fahrenheit using F = C * 9/5 + 32.

Bonus: also convert Fahrenheit back to Celsius.

Seconds to h:m:s: Ask for a total number of seconds (e.g., 7384). Compute hours, minutes, seconds using // and %.

Stretch (optional): Re‑format your outputs with f‑strings and rounded decimals where appropriate.

Instructor Notes & Troubleshooting

Common errors

SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal → mismatched quotes.

NameError: name 'x' is not defined → variable used before assignment or typo.

TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str → mixing types; convert with str() or int().

REPL tips

Use Up/Down arrows to recall commands.

Ctrl+C cancels a stuck input; exit() or Ctrl+D (macOS/Linux) / Ctrl+Z then Enter (Windows) to leave Python.

Style

Use spaces around operators: a + b.

Comment with # to explain a step.

Optional: Run from a File (if time permits)

Open a text editor, make a new file tip_splitter.py.

Paste the mini‑project code, save.

Run in terminal: python3 tip_splitter.py (macOS/Linux) or python tip_splitter.py (Windows).

Answer Key Snippets (for instructor)

Exit Ticket sample answers

"5" is a string (text), 5 is an integer (number).

input() returns a string; we convert when doing math.

A variable is a named box that stores a value for later use.

Bug fixes

age = int(input("Age: "))
print(age + 1)

bill = float(input("Bill: "))
people = int(input("People: "))
if people > 0:
    print("Per person:", bill / people)
else:
    print("People must be greater than 0.")

Micro‑Assessment (Optional if time remains)

Ask: What does // do? (Integer division.)

Ask: What is the type of input()? (String.)

Ask: Show a formatted money value using an f‑string with 2 decimals.

Example: print(f"${total:.2f}")
