## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this beginner level, students will be able to:

1. **Set up** a Python development environment
2. **Write** basic Python programs with proper syntax
3. **Use** variables, data types, and operators effectively
4. **Implement** conditional logic and loops
5. **Work with** Python's built-in data structures
6. **Create** and use functions with various parameter types
7. **Handle** errors gracefully in their programs
8. **Follow** Python coding standards (PEP 8)

## 🛠️ Practical Projects

Each lesson includes hands-on exercises and projects:

- **Calculator Program**: Demonstrates operators and control flow
- **Number Guessing Game**: Shows loops and user interaction
