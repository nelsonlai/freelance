🐍 Python Teaching Roadmap
1. Beginner Level (Foundations)

Goal: Build comfort with Python syntax, basic problem-solving, and coding habits.

Getting Started

What is Python? Installation & IDEs (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter)

Writing & running Python scripts

Comments & code style (PEP 8 basics)

Core Syntax

Variables & data types (int, float, str, bool)

Input/Output (input(), print())

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)

Control Flow

if / elif / else

for loops, while loops

break, continue, pass

Data Structures (Basics)

Strings (indexing, slicing, methods)

Lists (creation, indexing, methods)

Tuples

Dictionaries

Sets

Functions

Defining functions

Parameters & return values

Scope & lifetime of variables

Error Handling

Basic exceptions (try/except)

Common error messages

👉 Options at this stage:

Small projects: calculator, number guessing game, text-based adventure, simple data organizer.

2. Intermediate Level (Problem Solving & OOP)

Goal: Learn structured programming, file handling, and object-oriented design.

Functions (Advanced)

Default & keyword arguments

*args and **kwargs

Lambda functions

Recursion

File Handling

Reading/writing text files

CSV & JSON basics

Modules & Packages

Attributes & methods

__init__, __str__, __repr__

Inheritance & polymorphism

Encapsulation

Error Handling (Advanced)

finally

Custom exceptions

Data Structures (Advanced)

Stacks & Queues

Nested dictionaries/lists

Comprehensions (list, dict, set)

Testing

Unit testing with unittest or pytest

👉 Options at this stage:

Projects: to-do list app, file organizer, personal diary app, contact book, mini game with turtle or pygame.

3. Advanced Level (Professional Development)

Goal: Master advanced features, algorithms, and real-world applications.

Advanced OOP

REST APIs

Flask / FastAPI basics

Databases

SQLite with sqlite3

ORM basics (SQLAlchemy)

Testing & CI/CD

Mocking

Test-driven development (TDD)

Deployment

Packaging Python apps

Docker basics

Virtual environments & requirements.txt

👉 Options at this stage:

Projects: Blog API with Flask, chat app, stock price tracker, weather API app, machine learning project with scikit-learn.

4. Specialisations (Optional – Expert Path)

Once students reach advanced, they can branch into:

Data Science & ML → NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

Web Development → Flask, FastAPI, Django

Automation & Scripting → Selenium, Web Scraping, Task Automation

Cybersecurity / Systems → Sockets, Cryptography, OS-level scripting

Game Development → Pygame, Godot (with Python binding)

IoT & Robotics → MicroPython, Raspberry Pi
