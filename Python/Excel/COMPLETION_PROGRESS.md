## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Ready to Teach Now ✅
**Status: YES - You can start teaching immediately!**

**What you have:**
- Complete structure (100%)
- Sessions 1-3 fully developed (3 weeks of material)
- Session 4 theory guide complete
- All README files with detailed objectives
- Sample data working
- Project templates ready

**How to proceed:**
1. Teach Weeks 1-3 with complete materials
2. For Weeks 4+, use README as lecture outline
3. Create examples during or before each class
4. Students learn from live coding (very effective!)

### Option 2: Complete Next 3 Sessions
**Priority: Sessions 4-6 (Data operations & visualization)**

**Estimated Time: 15-20 hours**
- Session 4: 4 hours (.py + .ipynb)
- Session 5: 6 hours (.md + .py + .ipynb)
- Session 6: 6 hours (.md + .py + .ipynb)

These 3 sessions cover the most critical skills for your teaching goals (data manipulation, formatting, charts).

### Option 3: Complete All Materials
**Priority: All Sessions 4-11**

**Estimated Time: 40-50 hours**
- 8 sessions × (5-6 hours each)
- Includes all .md guides, .py scripts, .ipynb notebooks

This provides complete materials for entire semester.
