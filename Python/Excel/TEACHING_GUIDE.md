## 🎓 Teaching Best Practices

### Class Structure Guidelines

#### **Every Class Should Include**:
1. **Review** (10-15 min): Previous session recap, Q&A
2. **Lecture** (30-45 min): New concepts with slides/markdown
3. **Demo** (30-45 min): Live coding - show, don't just tell
4. **Lab** (45-90 min): Hands-on practice with support
5. **Wrap-up** (10 min): Summary, homework, next session preview

#### **Teaching Tips**:
- **Start with "Why"**: Explain real-world use cases
- **Live Code**: Students learn by watching you debug
- **Encourage Errors**: Make mistakes and show how to fix them
- **Pair Programming**: Have students work in pairs
