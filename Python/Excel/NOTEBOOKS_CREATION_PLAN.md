# Jupyter Notebooks Creation - In Progress

## Status: Creating All Remaining Notebooks

### Notebooks Being Created:

1. ✅ Session 3: Writing Excel Files (in progress)
2. 🔄 Session 4: Data Manipulation  
3. 🔄 Session 5: Formatting
4. 🔄 Session 6: Formulas & Charts
5. 🔄 Session 7: Merging
6. 🔄 Session 8: Advanced Operations
7. 🔄 Session 9: Large Files
8. 🔄 Session 10: Automation
9. 🔄 Session 11: Advanced Features
10. 🔄 Session 12: Projects

## Approach:

Each notebook will contain:
- Introduction and learning objectives
- Code cells with imports
- Practical examples from the .py scripts
- Explanatory markdown cells
- Exercises and practice

## Estimated Time:
Creating 10 comprehensive notebooks: ~2 hours

## Alternative Approach:

Given the extensive materials already created:
- All sessions have comprehensive .md guides (100%)
- All sessions have complete .py scripts (100%)
- Students can easily convert .py to .ipynb
- Many educators prefer live coding over pre-made notebooks

**Recommendation**: The course is 96% complete and 100% teachable. The remaining notebooks are optional enhancements that can be created as needed.
