Project Description:
- Use Yolo11
- Use Yolo Coco dataset
    -- download data.yaml and all Coco traing/validation/test data (pictures and data annotation)
    -- download other all necessary files
- Model, use YOLOv11 with 'm' medium traning model
- Give me the python code for training.

- Give me the python code to run a predict image and output the predict result to check the traning results

-- Deployment
  - Use Gradio for frontend
  - Select an image/picture
  - Show predict result at the below of the original picture
  - Show some animation while picture is in predicting

Implementation Notes:

Data Prep
- Create ./data/coco (or mount it) and run `python scripts/setup_coco.py` to download COCO 2017 splits plus data.yaml via Ultralytics (ZIPs stay in ./data/coco/downloads for reuse).

Training
- Train the medium model with `python scripts/train_yolov11m.py --epochs 150 --imgsz 1280` (weights default to yolo11m.pt and data to ./data/coco/data.yaml). The script auto-detects CUDA, Apple Silicon MPS, or CPU for the `--device` flag, but you can override it.

Single Image Prediction
- Run `python scripts/predict_image.py --weights runs/train/yolo11m-coco/weights/best.pt --source path/to/image.jpg --save`. The script auto-selects CUDA, MPS, or CPU for inference unless you override `--device`.

Deployment
- Launch the Gradio app `python app.py`.
- Upload or pick a sample image; a spinner shows while inference runs, and both original plus annotated predictions are rendered with detection metadata.
