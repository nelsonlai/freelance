/*
 * Problem: Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: string, tree, graph, greedy
 * 
 * Approach: String manipulation with hash map or two pointers
 * Time Complexity: O(n) or O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(h) for recursion stack where h is height
