// Problem: Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K
// Difficulty: Medium
// Tags: dp, math, search, heap
// 
// Approach: Dynamic programming with memoization or tabulation
// Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n and m are problem dimensions
// Space Complexity: O(n) or O(n * m) for DP table
