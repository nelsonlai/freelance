// Problem: Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three
// Difficulty: Easy
// Tags: array, math
// 
// Approach: Use two pointers or sliding window technique
// Time Complexity: O(n) or O(n log n)
// Space Complexity: O(1) to O(n) depending on approach

impl Solution {
    pub fn average_value(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
