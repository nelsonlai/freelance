/*
 * Problem: Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Tags: array, string, tree, graph, hash, search
 * 
 * Approach: Use two pointers or sliding window technique
 * Time Complexity: O(n) or O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(h) for recursion stack where h is height
