-- Problem: Average Time of Process per Machine
-- Difficulty: Easy
-- Tags: database

-- Approach: Calculate average processing time by grouping start and end activities
-- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is activities
-- Space Complexity: O(1)

SELECT 
    a1.machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2 ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id 
    AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
    AND a1.activity_type = 'start'
    AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;
