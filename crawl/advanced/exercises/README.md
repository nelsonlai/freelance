# Advanced Level Exercises

## Exercise 1: JavaScript-Heavy Site Scraper
Create a Selenium-based scraper that:
- Handles infinite scroll pages
- Waits for dynamic content to load
- Extracts data from JavaScript-rendered elements
- Handles pop-ups and modals
- Takes screenshots of important pages

**Hint**: Try scraping a modern SPA (Single Page Application) website.

## Exercise 2: High-Performance Async Scraper
Build an async scraper that:
- Scrapes 100+ URLs concurrently
- Uses connection pooling
- Implements rate limiting with semaphores
- Handles errors without stopping the entire process
- Saves results as they're collected (streaming)

## Exercise 3: Production Scrapy Project
Create a complete Scrapy project with:
- Multiple spiders for different websites
- Custom middleware for request handling
- Item pipelines for data validation and storage
- Settings for different environments (dev/prod)
- Logging and monitoring

## Exercise 4: Database-Backed Scraping System
Build a system that:
- Stores scraped data in PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Tracks scraping history and status
- Supports scheduled scraping (cron jobs)
- Provides a simple API to query scraped data
- Includes data deduplication

## Exercise 5: Anti-Bot Bypass
Research and implement techniques to:
- Rotate User-Agents
- Handle cookies and sessions
- Use proxies (if available)
- Mimic human behavior (random delays, mouse movements)
- Handle CAPTCHAs (using services like 2captcha)

**Note**: Only use these techniques on websites you have permission to scrape!
