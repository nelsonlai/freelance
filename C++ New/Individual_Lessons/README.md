## File Naming Convention

Each lesson follows this naming pattern:
- **Theory:** `XX_Lesson_Title.md`
- **Code:** `XX_Lesson_Title.cpp`

Where `XX` is the lesson number (e.g., `01`, `02`, `03`).

---

## Compilation Instructions

All C++ files are designed to compile with modern C++ standards (C++17 or later):

### GCC/Clang:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o program_name filename.cpp
```

### Visual Studio:
```cmd
cl /std:c++17 /EHsc filename.cpp
```

### CMake (for projects):
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(CppLesson)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_executable(program_name filename.cpp)
```
