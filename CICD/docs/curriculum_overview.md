# Python CI/CD Curriculum Overview

## Program Goals
- Explain why modern teams adopt CI/CD and quantify business impact.
- Provide hands-on experience building pipelines for a Python service.
- Expose learners to tooling choices, cloud deployment patterns, and advanced DevOps practices.

## Module Sequence
1. **Foundations** – Motivation, terminology, metrics.
2. **Continuous Integration** – Pipeline stages, tooling, GitHub Actions CI workflow.
3. **Continuous Delivery** – Deployment strategies, IaC, automated verification.
4. **Tooling Landscape** – CI/CD platforms, registries, observability stack options.
5. **Hands-on Project** – Guided FastAPI application with end-to-end automation.
6. **Advanced Topics** – Branching, security, progressive delivery, observability.
7. **Assessment & Resources** – Quizzes, labs, references, instructor support.

## Learning Path
- **Lecture + Demo**: Introduce concepts with slides and live pipeline walkthroughs.
- **Lab Sessions**: Students implement stages in the `sample_python_app` repository.
- **Reflection & Assessment**: Quizzes, project presentations, retrospectives.

## Supporting Materials
- Module guides (`docs/module*_*.md`) with talking points and classroom activities.
- Sample project under `sample_python_app/` showcasing CI/CD code.
- Slide outline (`docs/slide_outline.md`) for instructors to customize decks.
- Assessment resources in Module 7 for quizzes and rubrics.

## Suggested Schedule (Two-Week Intensive)
- **Day 1**: Module 1 lecture, discussion.
- **Day 2**: Module 2 lecture, Lab 1 kickoff.
- **Day 3**: Module 3 lecture, Lab 2 prep.
- **Day 4**: Module 4 overview, tool selection workshop.
- **Day 5**: Module 5 lab focus (CI configuration).
- **Day 6**: Module 5 continued (CD pipeline).
- **Day 7**: Module 6 deep dives, security drill.
- **Day 8**: Lab catch-up, observability workshop.
- **Day 9**: Student presentations.
- **Day 10**: Assessments, feedback, next steps.

Adjust pacing for semester-long courses by adding supplemental labs or guest lectures.
